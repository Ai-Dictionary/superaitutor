Perfect — let’s adapt your competitor’s “difference” section so it speaks to **all your audiences (students, teachers, employees, recruiters)** while keeping the same punchy, side‑by‑side style. Here’s a professional rewrite:

---

## Your Platform  
**VS**  
Other Generic Apps  

**Get Answers Instantly Anytime, Anywhere**  
> Delayed Responses or No Real Support  

**Role‑Specific Content Designed for Students, Teachers, Employees, and Recruiters**  
> Generic Material That Fits Only a Few Users  

**Smart Insights for Learners, Educators, and Employers to Track Progress**  
>> No Access for Teachers, Managers, or Recruiters to Monitor Growth  

**Personalised Paths Tailored to Each User’s Goals**  
>> One‑Size‑Fits‑All Approach With No Customisation  

**Interactive Explanations With Visuals, Examples, and Practical Scenarios**  
> Only Scores or Static Notes Without Real Understanding  

**All‑in‑One Affordable Platform for Learning, Teaching, and Hiring**  
>> Multiple Costly Subscriptions Needed Across Different Tools  

---

✨ This version:  
- Keeps the **same rhythm and structure** as your competitor’s.  
- Expands scope to **students, teachers, employees, recruiters**.  
- Highlights **progress tracking, personalization, affordability, and interactivity** for all user types.  

Would you like me to also design this as a **visual comparison table** (two columns: *Your Platform* vs *Other Apps*) so it looks sharper on your website?
